#Maintainable code

You don’t write clean markup for the browser, you don’t write it for the end users. You write it for the person who takes over the job from you. Much like you should use good grammar.

.img-wrap-50[![Maintainable code](assets/img/others-code.gif)]

Unstructured CSS in a large project often became a mess. Minor changes fix one problem but create three more and can require ugly hacks, and small CSS changes can break JavaScript functionality.

# Benefits of a smart scalable CSS Architecture

- Fewer styling rules
- Fewer styling collisions
- Long-term maintainability
- Faster ramp-up for new team members
- Easier collaboration between team members
- Smoother project handoffs

# How to manage css on complex websites?

Example 1: a large set of UI elements repeatable on a different pages.

.img-wrap-80.center[
    ![Complex UI example 1](assets/img/complex-ui-1.png)
]

# Is it possible to write a maintainable CSS?

Example 2: an admin panel with a lot of components that shares same controls inside.

#The separation of concerns
The separation of technologies is an incredibly good idea but it was not always implemented in real life products.
.columns[.col-50[
  ![The separation of concerns, old](assets/img/the-separation-of-concerns-old.png)
  .small[The separation of technologies: HTML is the structure, CSS is for the visual look and feel and JavaScript is for behaviour.]
].col-50[
  ![The separation of concerns, new](assets/img/the-separation-of-concerns-new.png)
  .small[Think of the "separation of concerns" and not layers of development.]
]]

<br>
After each new web technology is introduced the separation becomes much harder. What good is a CANVAS without any scripting? Should we animate in CSS or in JavaScript? Is animation behaviour or presentation? Should elements needed solely for visual effects be in the HTML or generated with JavaScript or with :after and :before in CSS?


---


#Separation of concerns

The idea if "separation of concerns" is that your HTML should only contain information about your content, and all of your styling decisions should be made in your CSS.<br>
This idea is reflected on a well known [csszengarden.com](http://www.csszengarden.com) site (you can completely redesign a site just by swapping out the stylesheet.)

.columns.small[.col-50[
``` html
<p class="text-center">Hello there!</p>

<style>
 .text-center {
   text-align: center;
 }
</style>
```
![No](assets/img/drake-no.png)
].col-50[
``` html
<p class="greeting">Hello there!</p>

<style>
.greeting {
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
```
![No](assets/img/drake-yes.jpeg)

]]

#Concerns are not so separated
Most of the time the CSS is like a mirror for the markup, perfectly reflecting my HTML structure with nested CSS selectors.
The markup isn't concerned with styling decisions, but CSS is very concerned with the markup structure.

.columns[.col-60[
``` html
<div class="company-info">
  <img src="https://www.epam.com/content/dam/epam/global/logo_white-blue.svg" alt="">
  <div>
    <h2>Epam</h2>
    <p>
      We specialize in 11 industries
      in 25 countries, delivering
      innovative solutions
      to our customers’
      most challenging problems.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

```
].col-40[

``` SCSS
.company-info {
  background-color: #999;
  border: 1px solid #76cdd8;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px #ccc;

  & > img {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }

  & > div {
    padding: 1rem;

    h2 { font-size: 1.25rem; }
    p { color: rgba(0,0,0,0.75); }
  }
}
```

#Decoupling styles from structure

Keeping selector specificity low and making your CSS less dependent on your particular DOM structure.

.columns[.col-50[
``` html
<div class="company-info">
  <img class="company-info-image" src="https://www.epam.com/content/dam/epam/global/logo_white-blue.svg">
  <div class="company-info-content">
    <h2 class="company-info-name">Epam</h2>
    <p class="company-info-body">
      We specialize in 11 industries
      in 25 countries, delivering
      innovative solutions
      to our customers’
      most challenging problems.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```
].col-50[
``` SCSS
.company-info {
  background-color: #999;
  border: 1px solid #76cdd8;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px #ccc;
}

.company-info-image {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.company-info-content { padding: 1rem; }

.company-info-name { font-size: 1.25rem; }

.company-info-body { color: rgba(0,0,0,0.75); }
```

#Dealing with similar components

Say we needed to add a new block a preview of an article in a card layout.
And it should look exactly like an company-info block with a rounded corners, box-shadow, etc.

.columns[.col-50[
``` html
<div class="company-info">
  <img class="company-info-image" src="...">
  <div class="company-info-content">
    <h2 class="company-info-name">Epam</h2>
    <p class="company-info-body">...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
].col-50[
``` html
<div class="article-preview">
  <img class="article-preview-image" src="...">
  <div class="article-preview-content">
    <h2 class="article-preview-name">Breaking news!</h2>
    <p class="article-preview-body">...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
]]


---

#Dealing with similar components

Option 1. Duplicate styles. But it will break the DRY principle

``` SCSS
.company-info {...}
.company-info-image {...}
.company-info-content {...}
.company-info-name {...}
.company-info-body {...}

.article-preview {...}
.article-preview-image {...}
.article-preview-content {...}
.article-preview-name {...}
.article-preview-body {...}
```

Option 2. Use SCSS @extend construction. Which is better not to use at all
``` SCSS
.article-preview {
  @extend .author-bio;
}
...
```
---


#Dealing with similar components

Option 3: Create a content-agnostic component

Our .company-info and .article-preview components have nothing in common from a "semantic" perspective.
But they have a lot in common from a design perspective.
We can create and reuse a new abstract component named after what they do have in common.

.columns[.col-50[
``` html
<div class="media-card company-info">
  <img class="media-card-image" src="...">
  <div class="media-card-content">
    <h2 class="media-card-name">Epam</h2>
    <p class="media-card-body">...</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="media-card article-preview">
  <img class="media-card-image" src="...">
  <div class="media-card-content">
    <h2 class="media-card-name">Breaking news!</h2>
    <p class="media-card-body">...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
].col-50[
``` SCSS
.media-card {...}
.media-card-image {...}
.media-card-content {...}
.media-card-content {...}
.media-card-name {...}
.media-card-body {...}
```
]]


---


# Content-agnostic CSS + utility classes

The content-agnostic CSS concept could be expanded to creation of a dosent of a small reusable classes each of which represent a small set of css rules
``` SCSS
.btn, .btn-primary, .btn-secondary
.badge
.card-list, .card-list-item
.img-round, .img-round,
.margin-top-10, .padding-left-large, .centered-text
.hidden-on-tablet, .hidden-on-less-than-medium
```
One html element could have a lot of css classes attached. This concept prefers composition to duplication. However it produces an html which looks like it uses just inline styles

``` html
<div class="flex text-lg text-dark">
  <span class="py-2 px-4 border-r border-dark-soft">hello</span>
  <button class="f6 br3 ph3 pv2 white bg-purple hover-bg-light-purple">Button Text</button>
</div>
```
As opposite to the 'separation of concerns' in this case The CSS isn't concerned with with the markup structure but HTML is very concerned about existing css classes.

#Why to use css organizing methodologies?

There is no "one true way" to write CSS but there are techniques that can keep CSS more organized and more structured, leading to code that is easier to build and easier to maintain.

.img-wrap-70[![Code organizing](assets/img/code-organizing.jpg)]


No matter what methodology you choose to use in your projects, you will benefit from the advantages of more structured CSS and UI. Some styles are less strict and more flexible, while others are easier to understand and adapt in a team.

# SMACSS

.columns[.col-50[

  A flexible guide to developing sites small and large. Is more style guide than rigid framework.
  At the very core of SMACSS is categorization. By categorizing CSS rules, we begin to see patterns and can define better practices around each of these patterns.

  There are five types of categories:

  - Base
  - Layout
  - Module
  - State
  - Theme

layout: true

# SMACSS

---
.columns[.col-60[

  **Base** rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element selectors, attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors.

  **Layout** rules divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.

  **Modules** are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.

  **State** rules are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state.

  **Theme** rules are similar to state rules in that they describe how modules or layouts might look.

##Base

.columns[.col-40[
``` css

body {

}
p, ul, li {
  padding: 0;
}
a, a:hover {
  color: blue;
}
input[type=text] {
  font-family: Georgia;
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #000;
}

```

##Project structure (using SCSS)

Every project needs some organization.
Much of the purpose of categorizing things is to codify patterns—things that repeat themselves within our design. Repetition results in less code, easier maintenance, and greater consistency in the user experience. Exceptions to the rule can be advantageous but they should be justified.



.columns[.col-40[
``` css
@import 'setting';
@import 'mixin';

@import 'base';

@import 'layout/grid';
@import 'layout/alternate';

@import 'module/btn';
@import 'module/profile';
@import 'module/nav';
```
].col-60[

  ![SMACSS](assets/img/project-structure.jpg)

#BEM


BEM stands for “Block”, “Element”, “Modifier”. It is a front-end methodology: a new way of thinking when developing Web interfaces.

###Block
A block is an independent entity, a “building block” of an application. A block can be either simple or compound (containing other blocks).

###Element
An element is a part of a block that performs a certain function. Elements are context-dependent: they only make sense in the context of the block that they belong to.

###Modifier
An entity that defines the appearance, state, or behavior of a block or element.

``` css

  .site-header { ... } /* block */
  .site-header__logo { ... } /* element */
  .site-header__logo—xmas { ... } /* modifier */
  .site-header__navigation { ... } /* element */

```

#Atomic design

A methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems:
Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages. 
Atomic elements combine together to form molecules which can combine further to form relatively complex organisms.
